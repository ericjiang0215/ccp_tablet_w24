            <p>I found this recipe for zucchini fritters on a food blog when I was looking for quick and easy dishes to
                make during undergrad. It uses minimal ingredients and can be done in less than half an hour. They’re
                delicious and filling and go great with dipping sauces.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.Transfer to the refrigerator
                to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away. Heat a 10 inch nonstick
                skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter. Pick the skillet up off of
                the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling
                the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan. Continue swirling until the
                batter is just set.</li>
            <li>Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about
                30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to
                cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining
                batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with
                paper towel as needed.
            </li>
