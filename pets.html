            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <br><p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <h2>Pluto</h2>
            <img src="images/pluto.jpg" class = "introimage" width = "400" alt="White dog looking up.">
            <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the
                Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
                personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to
                keep watch of his house. Do not let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
                mailman and squirrels every single day.</p>
            <br><p>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Plutoâ€™s favorite part of the day is
                his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy
                duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some
                practice with his toy duck.</p>

            <img src="images/maple_santa.JPG" class = "introimage" width = "400" alt="Brown striped tabby wearing a santa hat.">
            <p>Maple is a 2 year old tabby cat with brown stripes. She is very playful and friendly but also loves
                lounging in the sun! Maple is a huge fan of treats - she has even learned how to open doors to steal
                some extra treats.</p>
            <br><p>Sometimes Maple has boundless energy. At night, she gets the zoomies after eating her final meal of the
                day. It usually takes her another hour to settle down before she can take a long nap.</p>
